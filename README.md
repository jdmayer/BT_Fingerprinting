## Abstract
The world wide web is used by billions of people. 
The majority of users do not realise how easy it can be for websites to gather information about a person to sell it, or use it for their own purposes. 
Scandals, such as the Facebook data leak in 2018, reveal how the simple usage of a website can make private data accessable to third parties. One method of information gathering is the so-called web browser fingerprinting.
Still unknonwn to many, this tracking method provides an easy way to spy on users.

A part for solving this problem is to inform internet users about the dangers of tracking online and show ways to prevent the collection of their data.
Therefore, users need to have a rough idea on how their pieces of information get to third parties and have a save way to check if they are trackable online.

The objective of this thesis is to provide basic information about web browser fingerprinting. Further, it should suggest methods on how to mitigate the danger of being tracked. 
The development of a prototype should depict how easy it can be to identify and re-identify users online. Further, the user should be able to use the prototype to check if they are trackable.
