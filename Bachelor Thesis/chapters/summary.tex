all in all at least 1 page


In this chapter -> results of this thesis summarized + possible additions for the prototype outlined

\section{Result}
all objects explained + have they been done?

Objective : Analysis of different web browser fingerprinting techniques
 -> yes did outline different techniques:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Browser specific fingerprinting
	\item Canvas fingerprinting
	\item JavaScript Engine fingerprinting
	\item Cross browser fingerprinting
\end{itemize}
Further did outline different technologies + configurations first for a better understanding of the matter

Objective : Prototype
-> umsetzen von mindestens einer technique -> even did two
further tested the prototype with multiple browsers and OS
prototype is capable of creating hashes,saving them and later using them to reidentifying users.


\section{Prospect}
what can be done - probably adjustment with the help of heuristics + adjustment of the methods (still a bit faulty)
