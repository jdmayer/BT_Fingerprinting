-- refere to previous chapter
-- give good overview what needs what?

\section{Browser specific fingerprinting}
\section{Canvas fingerprinting}
\section{JavaScript Engine fingerprinting}
\section{Cross-Browser fingerprinting}
\section{Accelerometer fingerprinting}

\section{Comparison}
End Comparison with and Conclusion!
As seen in the descriptions, etc.

Neither of the techniques have the ability to distinguish between multiple users on a single device.  (\textcite{upi15}, p.5)
